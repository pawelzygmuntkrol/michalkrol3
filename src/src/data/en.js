  // BIOGRAPHY

    biographyHeader: "Biography",
    biographyParagraph:
      "Michał Król was born in 1984 in the region of Kujawy, Poland. He obtained a master's degree in Pedagogy and Psychology at the Kazimierz Wielki University in Bydgoszcz, Poland. His works are currently divided into two categories: STRUCTURAL COLLAGE with the use of industrial machines, which had helped the creation of structural paintings and INTERIOR illustrating the insight into the interior literally as well as figuratively, by utilizing X-Ray and magnetic resonance imaging. His source of inspiration were factories in Bydgoszcz, where he used to work in his free time and while studying. From there, he has begun using and assembling industrial materials in his works. Its characteristic collage and structural painting show that the materials can be re-used and put in a new and unique, lively context. His style is mainly inspired by structuralism and industrialism portraying the beauty of things that are present in our lives. His admiration for the works of Alberto Burri, Piotr Łakomy Andy Warhol and Hans Rudolf Giger inspired him to create his very own „structural collage” and “interior”. He has travelled to many countries, such as Australia, Swtizerland, Germany and Great Britain. Currently, he lives and works in Poznan, Poland.",
